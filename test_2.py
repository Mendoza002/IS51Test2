"""
The function of this program is to display the number of grades, the average grade, and the percentage of grades above average.
This is done by using the text file "Final.txt" and using the data from within to get each answer
First we would need the define the main of where we are extracing the data along with what we are focusing on, which is the scores.
Then we extract the from the file and have it set to read,
then we use equations to get the number of grades that are listed
then we use the sum of all grades and divided it with the total numbers of grades to get the average grade,
then finally we use the equations to figure out the percentage of grades that are above the average.
and print out the results of each of the three functions.
